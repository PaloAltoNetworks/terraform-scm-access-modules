# Prisma SASE Remote Networks Deployment and Configuration Example

A Terraform example for deploying Prisma SASE Remote Networks in a scalable and repeatable manner using either: 
- yaml
- #TODO:
  - json
  - hcl tfvars

This example can be used to familarize oneself with both Prisma SASE Remote Networks and Terraform - 
it creates everything required to support the deployment and configuration of a remote network.

**NOTE:**
A Remote Network will not go active until peerings are established with the remote site.
